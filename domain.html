                                        Before results are obtained, the input should be taken from the users. This was done by letting the user capture a photograph from a Chemistry related book or tutorial, or by letting the user select an image from their mobile phone gallery. The function of the Optical Character Recognition system is well defined by J. 
Walker et al [1]. For the identification of handwritten characters, P. Tang et al [2], have created a set of chemical symbol features that were based on a trajectory-based approach, as opposed to image processing.  After the identification and text extraction process, the next step was to identify the bonds between chemical names which were extracted. For the achievement of the goal, an ontology database was used to assist in the process. The required chemistry knowledge was stored in the ontology for easy retrieval. This knowledge was collected from resources such as reference books, G.C.E Advanced Level chemistry handbooks and practical guides. The ontology was created using the Protege ontology creation tool and mapped to android. A similar approach had been taken by L. Nachabe et al [3] when he developed a fitness-related mobile application based on the ontology which they created and presented a new ontologybased application that had been used for calculating the burned calories and had shown the trajectory of a runner during exercises.  According to the research paper published by J. Garcia et al [4], ontology usage has been involved in the possibility of evaluation of the quality and correctness of ontology tools. K. R. Taylor et al [5], cited about brought of data related to chemicals to the semantic web. They have used text mining tools to extract using the extraction results such as RDF triples which had allowed subsequent reuse and analysis with Semantic Web tools.  After identification of the characters in the image, the existence of the chemical was matched against the ontology. This was done using an algorithm based on character recognition. Once the chemical was identified, a rule-based system was used to retrieve the needed information from the ontology. Then the bond structure of the extracted chemical will be shown.  In situations where the users need to get the end products of a certain chemical reaction, OCR will be used to extract the text similar to the chemical identifying methods mentioned above. Once the chemicals are identified, the needed information will be retrieved from the ontology. Then, the information retrieved is processed by using the rule-based system to predict the end products. End products in the chemical reaction which was in the scanned image will be shown to the user. J. Chen et al [6], cited using a rule-based expert system and predicted end products of organic chemical reactions by storing over 1500 manually composed rules.  After the identification process is over, the next step was to visualize it using three- dimensional interactable objects. For example, if the selected portion of text contains H2O(water), the element size, bond angle and all the properties required to generate the 3D structure was retrieved from the ontology database, then that information was used to generate the structure within the 3D space. A similar approach had been made by Kang-Lin Peng and et al [7], where several complex image processing techniques were used to map a single 3D image. In this research, the whole process was performed using a customwritten algorithm and several other small programming techniques.
For further development of the 3D visualization technique, Kohei Arai [8], mentioned the possibility of presenting a 3D image using a low number of frames which resulted in a smoother 3D interactive experience even in devices with a low memory graphical processing unit.  As an addition, the question generation system was implemented as well. The research paper published by Gideon S. Mann [9] had mentioned about the creation of a noun ontology for question answering using natural language processing. In this process, questions were created using the information present in the ontology using natural language processing. Robert Stevens et al [10] had discussed in their research about the use of ontologies to create a knowledge base for bioinformatics by a categorization method.

                                        The process to identify bond structures consists of several steps. First, the relevant text was identified by capturing a photograph using the mobile phone camera.  Once the image was taken, the needed text was extracted using OCR technology. Then, the text was compared against the ontology content and the bond type was identified using a rule-based system and then shown to the user.
                                The main development tool used to develop the mobile application was Android Studio. Google Vision API was used to develop the OCR. The ontology was developed using Protégé, which is a free open source ontology editor. Object properties 
and data properties of the chemical elements, compounds, bonds and Relations among the instances and subclasses were structured using Protégé.  The created OWL file was queried using SPARQL query language using Androjena and Arqoid libraries.  3.2 Predicting end products of inorganic reactions 
The procedure of predicting end-products of reactions has a number of significant steps occurring in the backend of the application. First, the relevant text was identified by capturing a photograph using the mobile phone camera.  The text was extracted using OCR technology and segmented to get information related to each reactant. Once the reactants were extracted along with the conditions, a validation query will be run to compare the reactant names. If the reactant names were valid and contained in the ontology, then another set of queries was run to check whether the two reactants react with each other under given conditions. Using that information, the end products will be deduced using a rule-based system. The main development tool used to develop the mobile 
application was Android Studio. Google Vision API was used to develop the OCR. The ontology was developed using Protégé and the properties and relations among the instances and subclasses were structured using Protégé.  The created OWL file was queried using SPARQL query language using Androjena and Arqoid libraries. The rule-based system was developed based on the currently existing j-easy rules engine. 
 3.3 Balancing chemical equations and dynamic generation of questions and answers Balancing chemical equations is one of the crucial parts when solving calculations related to physical chemistry. The reason is that, the first step of chemical calculations related to chemical reactions is to balance the relevant chemical equations. The application allows the users to view the balanced equations for any given inorganic reaction. This was done by letting the users capture an image of the relevant equation. Once the image was captured, the text was extracted using OCR technology.  The extracted text was segmented to get the reactants in the reaction. Next, an advanced version of the algebraic algorithm was used to balance the given reaction. Finally, the balanced reaction was shown to the users.
As an addition to the system, a question generation section is added. The method used in the generation of the multiple-choice questions is by the division of the relevant questions into tokens. After tokenizing, then a set of algorithms used for the generation of question types related to multiple-choice questions would be done. The questions generated based on the information stored in the ontology. The concept of the ontology used to develop the knowledge base relevant to the Advanced Level Chemistry syllabus. The content used to generate the questions were retrieved from the Chemical Bonding and Inorganic Chemistry sections in the ontology.   Based on the information retrieved from the ontology created, multiple-choice questions generated which can be used by the prospective users. The questions are shown to the user as a quiz, thus enabling him to use his knowledge to solve the questions.  
Programming languages like Java and Python and frameworks like Springboot, Apache Jena Semantic Web framework, and techniques like natural language processing and lexical databases like wordnet and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) were used for the retrieval of  relevant data from owl format ontology and  for the creation of the questions and answers. Ontology creation tools Protégé used as the main tool in the creation of the ontology. Tool sets like NLTK (Natural language toolkit) also had assisted in the creation of questions and answers.  
3.4 Interactive visualization of  elements and bond structures In addition to viewing of the bond structures of compounds, the users have the ability of viewing the 3D model of the same. To generate the bond structure of the relevant compound as a three-dimensional interactable object, first the system will 
access the ontology database to get the atomic radius of both the atoms and create the atoms in the respective atomic sizes. Next, the system will retrieve the bond type, bond length to connect the atoms along with the bond angle form the ontology to make the three-dimensional object more accurate.  To get the correct bond shapes and angles, the system will calculate it using the VSEPR Theory. Then the system will connect the atoms with the required number of bonds with the accurate bond length and with the correct bond angles. As the rendering process completes, the user will be able to interact with the three-dimensional object. Additionally, the users also have the ability to view the electronic configuration of elements.

                                        Until now, there has been little work done on the basis of inorganic chemistry. The functionalities of applications that currently exist in android and iOS app stores are not similar to the main functions of the proposed system, as mentioned in the above section.
The machine learning algorithm which will be used to train the proposed application to identify chemical bonds will be based on one of researches done in order to identify bonds in any material. The algorithm mentioned in the research paper will be implemented in the proposed system and will be further developed in order to identify chemical bonds.
Numerous researches were done for predicting organic synthesis and drug analysis using machine learning. By the proposed system, a machine learning algorithm will be created and developed in order to predict end-products of inorganic chemicals under different conditions.
Numerous researches have been done for generating past paper questions automatically. However, analysing the pattern between questions in past papers and then creating a model question based on that requires an advanced algorithm. This will be implemented in the real world by the proposed application
Although several researches were done for 3D model visualization models have been written, the real world application as to how the 3D objects should lie on the planes have not been published. The proposed application will be using an algorithm to train the system to place the objects in the required places in the 3D plane in order to show the end-users how the bonds between chemicals are present in 3D.
